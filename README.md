using std::cpp 2016
-------------------

Presentation from Joaquín Mª López Muñoz at [using std::cpp 2016](http://usingstdcpp.org/using-stdcpp-2016/) and associated material.
* [Put your types to work](https://github.com/joaquintides/usingstdcpp2016/raw/master/Put%20your%20types%20to%20work.pdf) (video in Spanish): The main advantage of statically typed languages is that they can dectect programming errors before code is executed. With relatively simple C++ techniques, it is possible to increase the number of errors that do not progress to production or even make the compiler correct them automatically with no penalty on program performance.
